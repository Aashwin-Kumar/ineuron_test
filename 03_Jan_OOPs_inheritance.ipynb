    "Q1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: What is inheritance?\n",
    "- Its kind a mechanism which allow a class to inherits the attribute and methods/functions of another class.\n",
    "- the child class can inherits all the functionality of parent class and create a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why its Used?\n",
    "- prime use of inheritance is reusablity, pramote structural approach and easy to maintain huge codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- there are basically 4 types of inheritance:\n",
    "Single Inheritance.\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance.\n",
    "multilevel Inheritance.\n",
    "Hierarchical  Inheritance.\n",
    "Hybrid Inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self,name)\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    \n",

    "    print(\"hello, world\") # as you can see hello method is repeating in both class\n",
    "    \n",
    "-so how can we reuse the hello() method? \n",
    "- to reuse the hello() method we have to create a relationship betwen parent and child class here,\n",
    "person is a parent(base class or super class) and employee is a child(derived or subclass)\n",

    "- in python its asymbol or keyword that defines the visibility and accessabilty of a class, methods, variables within program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protected:\n",
    "- its like hybrid version of private and public, its not for everone but only can access within class and its subclass.\n",

    "\n",
    "Public:\n",
    "- its totally open, anyone can access this variable and methods.\n",
    "- its like open park aynyone can go and enjoy.\n",
    "- no public keyword is required for declaring public class or method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private:\n",
    "- its very strict modifire coz its only acccess within the same class, they are hidden from outer class.\n",
    "- its like a private diary; no one outside the class should see it.\n",
    "- its declared using underscore _ before their names.\n",

    "- its bascially use to avoid the method overrides.\n",
